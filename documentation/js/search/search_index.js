Follow the guidelines to contribute to the seed.\nContribution Guidelines\nBefore you start working with Clarity, please complete the following steps:\n\nRead our code of conduct.\nRead our Developer Certificate of Origin. All contributions to this repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.\n\nContribution Flow\nHere are the typical steps in a contributor's workflow:\n\nFork the main Clarity seed repository. \nClone your fork and set the upstream remote to the main Clarity repository.\nSet your name and e-mail in the Git configuration for signing.\nCreate a topic branch from where you want to base your work.\nMake commits of logical units.\nMake sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).\nPush your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\nSubmit a pull request.\n\nExample:\n# Clone your forked repository\ngit clone git@github.com:/clarity-seed.git\n\n# Navigate to the directory\ncd clarity-seed\n\n# Set name and e-mail configuration\ngit config user.name \"John Doe\"\ngit config user.email johndoe@example.com\n\n# Setup the upstream remote\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware/clarity-seed.git\n\n# Create a topic branch for your changes\ngit checkout -b my-new-feature master\n\n# After making the desired changes, commit and push to your fork\ngit commit -a -s\ngit push origin my-new-featureStaying In Sync With Upstream\nWhen your branch gets out of sync with the master branch, use the following to update:\ngit checkout my-new-feature\ngit fetch -a\ngit pull --rebase upstream master\ngit push --force-with-lease origin my-new-featureUpdating Pull Requests\nIf your PR fails to pass CI, or requires changes based on code review, you'll most likely want to squash these changes into existing commits.\nIf your pull request contains a single commit, or your changes are related to the most recent commit, you can amend the commit.\ngit add .\ngit commit --amend\ngit push --force-with-lease origin my-new-featureIf you need to squash changes into an earlier commit, use the following:\ngit add .\ngit commit --fixup \ngit rebase -i --autosquash master\ngit push --force-with-lease origin my-new-featureMake sure you add a comment to the PR indicating that your changes are ready to review. GitHub does not generate a notification when you use git push.\nFormatting Commit Messages\nUse this format for your commit message:\n\n\n\n\nSigned-off-by: Your Name Writing Guidelines\nThese documents provide guidance creating a well-crafted commit message:\n\nHow to Write a Git Commit Message\nClosing Issues Via Commit Messages\n\nReporting Bugs and Creating Issues\nYou can submit an issue or a bug to our GitHub repository.  You must provide:\n\nInstruction on how to replicate the issue\nThe version number of Angular\nThe version number of Clarity\nThe version number of Node\nThe browser name and version number\nThe OS running the seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n
